# NXU-BAN6420-Module-2-Assignment
In this Assignment's Zip file, I have the following documents.
*A Jupyter Source File named 'Mod2Assignment'.
*R script named 'unzip'
*A CSV file named 'Total'

The Jupyter Source File contains the following codes
1. A function that accepts an Employee's Full Name and returns the employees details from the file 'Total.csv'.
2. A script that plots a Bar chart - displaying the Total Salaries paid to employess per year based on the data provided in the CSV file - 'Total.csv'.
3. Another Script that calls the function in 1. above, returns the Employess details, stores these details in a new CSV file named - Employee.csv and zips the csv file in a Zip folder named 'Employee_Profile.zip'. All files are generated in the folder named 'Module2'
     - Here the script accepts the Employee's Full name, displays the Employees details.
     - The user is then asked if they would like to Export the returned data in CSV format [Y/N]
     - If yes, the CSV file is exported, then the user is asked to confirm if they would like to zip the CSV file. If yes, the CSV file is zipped.
     - If No, the program ends.
  
The R script is meant to unzip the zip file generated by the python code and display its contents.
